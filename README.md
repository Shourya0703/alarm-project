## 📌 Project Overview  
This is a simple **Python-based Alarm Clock** application that allows the user to set an alarm by entering hours and minutes. When the system time matches the alarm time, a **voice alert** is triggered using the `pyttsx3` text-to-speech library.

The project demonstrates the use of:  
- Loops  
- Condition checking  
- Time and datetime modules  
- Text-to-speech (TTS) in Python  
- Basic Python logic building
